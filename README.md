# Lead-Score-Case-Study
Building a Mchine Learning Model for an X education company to identify what leads have higher conversion rates.

**Overview**
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website they are given a call to action and once they act upon it the company generate leads. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are generated the comny acts upon cob=nverting the leads to paying customers. However, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30% which is not as decent as the company expects it to be. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

**Business Objective**
Goals of the Case Study is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
